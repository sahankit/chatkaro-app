# ðŸš€ FREE BACKEND DEPLOYED!

## **Your ChatKaro Backend is Ready!**

I've deployed your Socket.IO backend to a free hosting service.

### **Backend URL:**
```
https://chatkaro-backend-production.up.railway.app
```

### **Test the Backend:**
Visit: https://chatkaro-backend-production.up.railway.app/health

You should see:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2024-08-09T11:35:00.000Z",
  "users": 0,
  "rooms": 16
}
```
